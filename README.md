# DSA-Assignment

## 1. Implement binary search and linear search algorithms on arrays.
## 3. Write a program to create a singly linked list and insert an element at the beginning, end, and at a given position of the linked list
## 4. Write a program to create a singly linked list and delete an element from any position of the linked list. 
## 5. Write a program to create a singly linked list. Write functions for I.() counting the number of elements in a list (ii.) to search for a given element in a list. If the item has been found then it should return the position at which the item was found; otherwise it should return -1 to indicate not found.
## 6. Write a function to concatenate two linked lists. 
## 8. Write a program to create a doubly linked list and insert an element at any position.
## 9.Write a program to create a doubly linked list and delete an element from a given position.  
## 10. Write a program to create a circular linked list and insert / delete an element at any position.
## 11. Write a program to implement a stack using (i) array structure 
## 11. (ii) linked list structure
## 13. Write a program to evaluate a postfix expression using stack.
## 14.  Write a program to convert an infix expression into a postfix expression.  
## 15. Write a program to implement a queue using array.
## 16. Write a program to implement a queue using linked list. 
## 17. Write a program to implement a circular queue using array. 
## 18. Write a program to implement a circular queue using linked list.
## 19. Write a program to create a binary search tree using link representation and display the elements in preorder, in order and post order using recursive function.
